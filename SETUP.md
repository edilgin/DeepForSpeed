   then video settings and then select 1024x768 then restart the game and game should be at 1024x768. The last step is placing the window at
   the top left of the screen because my program takes screenshots of that part of the screen.

3-   You can either use a pretrained model or start a new model and train it yourself. If you want to use a trained model go to the
