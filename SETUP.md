1-   Enter mods file and select "scripts" and "dinput8.dll" files and put them into the need for speed most wanted game folder
   then select "HotPositionL2RA.HOT" and copy it into "TRACKS" folder these are mod folders that i customised a little for my project
   (reference: https://github.com/ExOptsTeam/NFSMWExOpts but if you use it you will have to customise the code yourself)

2-   Start the game at 800x600 resolution if you dont know what resolution the game runs at just start the game then enter the settings
   then video settings and select 800x600 then restart the game and game should be at 800x600. Then make sure you place the window at
   the top left of the screen because my program takes screenshots of that part of the screen.
